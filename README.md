# Island Generator with Perlin Noise

This is a JavaScript project that generates random islands using the Perlin Noise algorithm. The Perlin Noise algorithm is a noise generation technique that is commonly used in games and computer graphics to create complex and realistic terrain and landscapes.

## How to Use
